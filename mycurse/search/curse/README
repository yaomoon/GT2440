first install these packages:

    sudo apt-get install libncurses5 libncurses5-dev 
    sudo apt-get install libncursesw5 libncursesw5-dev 

Next:

    make
    sudo make install

BUG:
    when using chinese version ubuntu
    if you have binary file in working dir
    xxx will end with segfault. 

    Now the bug above is fixed. You don't need to delete the binary file. 


Now, it can display Chinese. Just use the shared library libncursesw.so.5, not
libncurses.so.5, so you need run the command below to compile the programme.

    gcc xxx.c -o xxx -lncursesw 

If there is no libncursesw.so.5 in your OS, you should install it first.

    sudo apt-get install libncursesw5-dev

MAC:

    since I do not know how to install dev headers for ncurses on mac, so I stupidly copied the 

        ncurses.h

    from a linux machine, and then use

        gcc -I.

    it sucks.
